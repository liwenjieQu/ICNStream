This is a customized branch and unsupported fork of ndnSIM version1. More functions are developed for research purpose.

Development history is hidden to protect sensitive data and personal information.

2) Building ns-3
----------------

The code for the framework and the default models provided
by ns-3 is built as a set of libraries. User simulations
are expected to be written as simple programs that make
use of these ns-3 libraries.

Prerequisite: mysql (cpp-connector)

Please update the include & lib path in src/ndnSIM/wscript.

Afterwards,
  ./waf configure --enable-tests
followed by
  ./waf 
in the the directory which contains
this README file. The files built will be copied in the
build/ directory.

The current codebase is expected to build and run on the
set of platforms listed in the RELEASE_NOTES file.

Other platforms may or may not work: we welcome patches to 
improve the portability of the code to these other platforms.
